        What the Nigeria Tax Act, 2025 Means for Technological Companies in Nigeria: 7 Things Every Startup Founder Needs to Know.
      </h1>

      <section className="mb-6">
        <p>
          The Nigeria Tax Act, 2025 is a major reform in Nigeria&apos;s tax system. It brings together and replaces several older tax laws, such as the Companies Income Tax Act, Value Added Tax Act, and Capital Gains Tax Act.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          More importantly, it introduces new rules that apply directly to Nigeria&apos;s growing digital economy. For technological companies, whether Nigerian or foreign, this new law marks a turning point. It sets out clear rules for how digital businesses will be taxed and what is expected of them in terms of compliance.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Of course, technology Companies are not left of the picture. Some of the key updates provided in the Act that relate to tax exemption and tax imposed on technology companies include the following:
        </p>

      <section className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. The inclusion of digital and virtual assets as taxable items</h2>
        <p>
          According to Section 4(1)(i) and Section 34(1)(a), income arising from dealing, selling, or trading in digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, are chargeable to tax. This implies that if a business earns profits through such transactions, such profits are to be declared and tax paid in consequence.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">However, there are certain exceptions:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
          <li>
            Where the company&apos;s annual sales are below ₦150 million and the company&apos;s profit is below ₦10 million, no tax would be levied.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where the proceeds from selling such digital assets are re-invested in Nigerian enterprises within a single year, the company may be granted partial exemption from capital gains tax.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Compulsory tax on foreign technology companies</h2>
        <p>
          The Act stipulates that foreign technology companies must be taxed in Nigeria if they are making profits from Nigerian consumers. This is based on a principle referred to as Significant Economic Presence (SEP), provided for under Section 17(9)(b) of the Act.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Foreign companies like Meta, Google, Tiktok, Microsoft clouds, Adobe Reader, etc., that offer services like online advertisements, online payment, cloud computing, or digital training to Nigerian consumers will be taxed.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          This applies even if these technology companies have no physical offices or workers in Nigeria. These companies will pay tax for the income they derive from Nigerian customers, and where there is no withholding of tax at source, they will be taxed at least 4% of such income for the Nigerian government.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Hence, it is vital for local companies in partnership with these foreign companies to ensure such tax clearances are included into their operations before or at the time of venturing into such partnerships.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Provision of Value Added Tax (VAT) on Online Services</h2>
        <p>
          The Nigeria Tax Act reiterates the addition of VAT on online services. Sections 144 to 151 of the Act imply that VAT is payable on digital services provided to Nigerian consumers, irrespective of the residence of the company.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          This includes software downloads, mobile apps, cloud computing, video and music streaming services, and even web-based lessons paid for. Even if the service is offered by a local IT company or an offshore firm, 7.5% VAT must be collected and remitted to the tax department.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Incentive to Local Technology Companies</h2>
        <p>
          The Act gives relief and incentive to local technology companies and start-ups. Section 13(2) of the Act relieves the salaries of employees of a technology start-up with non-resident (foreign) employees, provided that they are taxed in the country of origin.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          This is a welcome relief for start-ups that collaborate with remote teams or offshore developers.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 font-semibold">Are there any exceptions for which local companies get the reliefs?</p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Yes, the act provides an exemption. It expressly provides that the employer has to be an established startup or a &quot;technology-driven service&apos; company. Sub-section 13(6) lists such services as financial technology companies (fintech), application development, online education platforms, and software companies.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Provision of Research and Development (R&D) relief</h2>
        <p>
          Another benefit for technology companies is in the form of R&D relief. Through Section 13, companies can offset against taxable profits the cost they spend on R&D up to 5% of their turnover annually. This will encourage innovation and help companies developing new software or building technology products.
        </p>

      <section className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">6. Imposition of new requirements on Multinational Technology Companies</h2>
        <p>
          The Act imposes new requirements on multinational technology companies. Section 192 requires that all transactions between a Nigerian company and its foreign parent or subsidiary have to be on an arm&apos;s length basis.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          That is, the prices have to be reasonable and similar to what would be charged by or to unrelated parties. These provisions are most relevant to companies offering group-shared services, licensing intellectual property, or offering cloud infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Equally, Section 6(3) states that when a foreign technology subsidiary of a Nigerian company pays less than the minimum rate in its country of origin, its Nigerian parent company must remit the deficit in Nigeria.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          This prevents companies from relocating earnings to locations with little or no taxes, and guarantees Nigeria gets its share of taxes from activities related to its economy.
        </p>

          7. Exemption from personal income tax for angel investors, venture capitalists, private equity funds, accelerators and incubators
        </h2>
        <p>
          Section 163(1)(m) provides for exemption from payment of personal income tax for gains accruing from the disposal of assets by an angel investor, venture capitalist, private equity fund, accelerators, or incubators with respect to a labelled startup provided the assets have been held in Nigeria for a minimum of 24 months.
        </p>

          Summarily, the Nigeria Tax Act, 2025 shows that the Nigerian government is seriously paying attention to the digital economy. The law puts down clear tax regulations for local and foreign technological companies and offers modern tax doctrines that cover how digital companies presently operate. From digital assets and virtual services to cloud platforms and cross-border transactions, the law covers a wide array of technology operations.
